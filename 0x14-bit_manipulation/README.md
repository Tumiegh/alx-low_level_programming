Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation involves manipulating individual bits of data in a variable, typically using bitwise operators such as AND, OR, XOR, shift left, and shift right. This allows you to perform operations at the bit level, which can be useful for tasks like setting or clearing specific bits, checking the status of individual bits, or optimizing certain algorithms.
