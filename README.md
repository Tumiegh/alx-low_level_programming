# This repository contains `alx` C projects and other low level programming exercices.

### AS A PROGRAMMER, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU GET STUCK?
- To help you track down that bug, start reading your code aloud. 
- Pretend that a programmer friend is sitting right next to you. 
- Explain what your code is doing and how it works. As you talk through your code, youâ€™ll find the problem. If you donâ€™t, have your imaginary friend ask you questions during your explanation., 9-fizz_buzz.c, 100-prime_factor.c, 101-print_number.c
`Donâ€™t worry about going mental. Youâ€™re a C programmer. Youâ€™re already mental.` ðŸ˜…


As a bonus, talking through your code also helps you identify which portions need to have comments and what the comments should be.
